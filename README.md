**Hiiiii I'm Grover! Putting more of my Pony Town info here.**

Just because my character has a certain pride flag does not mean I personally identify that way. I personally am **Trans Boy+, AroAllo, and Polyam** (+ more ish), so if a pony has something else that's my headcanon for them.

Main fandoms include **Life Series, EPIC the musical, Good Omens, Indigo Park, and more.**

Cuddles, hiding, boops, talking, roleplay, etc is okay! I'm 18 so only romantic rp if you're 18+ plz, minors can still talk to me ig but most times I'm on the 18+ server so.
Whispering is the easiest way to get my attenion + it helps me read your messages away from everyone elses, but ofc it's not mandatory.
While I'm open to interaction if you friend request me without even talking I probably won't accept at first, and if you boop me 100 times w/o speaking I'm only gonna like boop back once.
